With this enabled, the addon checks User Agent strings that were not identified as bots against a list of known valid browser user agent strings. Any user agents which don't match are stored in the database and then periodically emailed to the addon author for analysis to detect previously unidentified bots.<br />
<br />
By default the system sends emails directly to the addon author at knownbots@hampel.io - but you can have it send email to any address if you want to check what information the emails contain. You may manually forward the email to the above address, or else post user agent strings in the support thread for analysis. To collect user agents but not email them, enable this option but leave the email address blank. Please read the privacy statement included in the addon instructions.
